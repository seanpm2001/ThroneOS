# BathHouseOS

## ThroneOS

### About

ThroneOS is a subsystem of BathHouseOS, designed for making any toilet more advanced. I don't know much of what can be done right now, so feature requests are needed.

### Features

#### Automatic flushing

Have the toilet automatically flush after `x` seconds of no motion in front of it.

#### Flush direction

[Proposed, extra feature] change the direction the toilet flushes.

#### Blender

[Proposed, extra feature] this idea may be extreme and impractical: close the lid, and have the toilet blend everything inside of it. No more plungers.

#### Automatic closing

Automatically close all lids on the toilet after `x` seconds of inactivity.

#### Automatically put down

Automatically put the toilet seat down after `x` seconds of inactivity

#### Automatically put up

Automatically put the toilet seat up after `x` seconds of inactivity

#### Scale

[Proposed, extra feature] weigh yourself with the toilet, and give before/after results.

#### Tank meter

Check how many liters/gallons of water are in the toilet tank.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/ThroneOS/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main BathHouseOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
